Created a test like application with a question and 4 multiple choice answers using React with React-Router-Dom and TailwindCSS for styling. 
Used Context API and reducer hook for global state management to all components.
Stored 10 static questions into Context API and each action that manipulated the state was stored in reducer hook so it did not look convulated in main component pages.
The Quiz section allowed user to click on an answer and automatically show whether they  got it right or not before moving onto the next question.
Has a results page that showcased how many they got correct out of all total questions available.
